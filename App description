Water Tracker and Reminder app allows the user to drink water regularly. The application
calculates the daily water need for the user by taking some information like weight, exercise
schedule. The app allows setting the preferable size for containers like a glass and bottle.
The app also allows for schedule reminders and offers a statistical analysis of the amount of what the user has consumed over the course of a day, week, month 
or year. The app saves all the previous logs and allows to modify them. Widgets are also available to give a quick view of the progress.
